You are Gunnar, as seemingly average every day sheep, with a gun. You can run and jump and well, shoot. But somehow, you've ended up in the evil Shephard's gauntlet. You need to make it to the end. But it isn't as easy as it looks. The Shepard has fixed it so that you need to collect 50% of the fruit to leave a level. Work hard, and you can move on.
